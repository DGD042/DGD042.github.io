My research is centered on investigating the movement of water through Earth's systems and its impact on transport and biogeochemical reactions of chemical constituents that influence ecosystems and communities. To achieve this, I utilize numerical models, data consolidation and analysis, and statistical methods within high-performance computing environments to assess hydrologic ecosystems. My key research interests encompass surface water-groundwater interactions, groundwater hydrology, coastal hydrology, geophysics, geostatistics, climatology, and meteorology.

## Research Interests

- **Surface water-groundwater interactions**: Understanding nutrient and contaminant dynamics between surface water and groundwater systems, including their feedback mechanisms and implications for water resources management.
- **Groundwater hydrology**: Investigating the movement and quality of groundwater, including aquifer recharge, discharge, and contamination processes.
- **Geophysics**: Applying geophysical techniques to study subsurface structures and processes, enhancing our understanding of the nested nature of mountain hydrological systems.
- **Coastal Hydrology**: Examining the interactions between coastal waters and groundwater, including the effects of sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion on freshwater resources.
