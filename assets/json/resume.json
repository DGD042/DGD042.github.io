    "summary": "My research is centered on investigating the movement of water through Earth's systems and its impact on transport and biogeochemical reactions of chemical constituents that influence ecosystems and communities. To achieve this, I utilize numerical models, data consolidation and analysis, and statistical methods within high-performance computing environments to assess hydrologic ecosystems. My key research interests encompass surface water-groundwater interactions, groundwater hydrology, physical hydrology, geophysics, geostatistics, climatology, and meteorology.",
